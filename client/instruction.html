        <span class="large-title"> Guess the secret word...</span>

        <!-- instructions here -->
        <br>
        Semantle will tell you how semantically similar it thinks your word is to the secret word.
        When the user enters a (one) word, the semantic proximity is measured using the Word2vec model - two words will
        be semantically close the more likely they are to be used in a similar context.
        <br>
        The collection of texts that forms the basis for understanding the context between the words (data) is
        Wikipedia.
        The highest possible similarity is 100. This indicates that the words are the same and you have won.
        <br>
        At the beginning of the game, the user is required to register on the login page and enter a username and
        password.
        <br>
        Throughout the game the user will be shown an instructions button where all the instructions and rules of our
        game will be written.
        <br>
        In addition, when the game starts, a timer is activated, if the user guesses the word in the allotted time, he
        earns a point.
        <br>
        At the end of the game, the user will be shown how long it took him to guess the drawn word and whether he broke
        his record from the previous time, and it will also show how many points he has so far.
        Every day a word is drawn at midnight according to the RANDOM WORD API model.
